The dodger would (usually) pull his headout of the hole in time to avoid getting hit, but sometimes hewasn't fast enough. African Dodgers were so commonplace thatsome sadistic people would bring a hard (wooden or iron) ballinto any carnival that came to town, knowing they'd have achance to throw it at a black man's head and cause him seriousinjury.""

"White Dog (1988)","
        Directed by Samuel Fuller. Cast: Kristy McNichol, PaulWinfield, Burl Ives, Jameson Parker, Christa Fuller, SamFuller, Lynne Moody, Marshall Thompson. A German shepherd isadopted by an actress who learns that the dog has been trainedto attack only African Americans. Now it's up to an animaltrainer to try to change the vicious dog.
        """"This is a thriller, and it's also a complete metaphor,""said Sam Fuller of his controversial feature which wentunreleased theatrically for ten years. Loosely based on a storyby Romain Gary, White Dog concerns a dog trained to attackblacks. Paul Winfield portrays a trainer who takes on the taskof deprogramming the animal on behalf of its new owner (KristyMcNichol). With frequent point-of-view shots from the dog'sperspective, Fuller makes a case for his thesis, which is thatracism is ""a disease created by man"" and that infecting theanimal is itself a form of violence. The idea of a ""white dog""is dehumanizing, but accusations of racism toward Fuller wereperhaps derived from a misunderstanding of the film's content,as well as intent. In Gary's story, the dog is retrained toattack whites, perpetuating the cycle of racism; Fuller'sversion has Winfield (in a fine performance) attempting to curethe dog. Overlooking Fuller's history of anti-racist films, theNAACP urged a boycott, inspiring the studio to shelve thefinished film.""

The dodger would (usually) pull his headout of the hole in time to avoid getting hit, but sometimes hewasn't fast enough. African Dodgers were so commonplace thatsome sadistic people would bring a hard (wooden or iron) ballinto any carnival that came to town, knowing they'd have achance to throw it at a black man's head and cause him seriousinjury."" In this film comedian Tom Howard plays a man on acarnival midway who gets suckered into substituting for theAfrican Dodger. 91 min. ;

                    Directed by Alan Crosland. Cast: Al Jolson, May McAvoy, WarnerOland, William Demarest, Eugenie Besserer, Otto Lederer, JosefRosenblatt. A melodramatic story of a Jewish cantor's son (AlJolson) who aspires to be a jazz singer despite his father'sobjection and religious tradition. In motion picture history,this marks the first feature film to utilize synchronous sound.Jolson's songs include ""Toot, toot, tootsie"", ""Blue skies"", and""Mammy"". 89 min. ; 
                    ""Since its premiere in 1927, many jazz critcs haveoverlooked The Jazz Singer, America's pioneer talking picture,in the history of American jazz film. Despite its title, thetalkie's account of Old World vs. New World tension and Jewishassimilation has little to do with the jazz sound made famousby such artists as Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton. Yetas crtic Krin Gabbard argues, the film's appropriation of thetitle jazz reflects the cultural understanding of ""jazz"" duringthe American Jazz Age. In the 1920s, jazz, referring in generalto up-tempo music, represented the emotional release andfreedom of a generation striving to break established socialconventions. While African American contributions to jazz werelargely overlooked in the rise of Paul Whiteman and Al jolson'sfame, blackface minstrelsy of the age represented whiteAmericans attempt to ventriloquize blacks associated withsupposed freedom of Negro primitivisim. Using jazz to representRaboniwitz's break from Old World tradition and featuring afinale in blackface minstrelsy, The Jazz Singer (as Gabbardargues) lays the foundation for cultural representations ofjazz in American cinema.""

"Whoopee!(1930)","Directed by Thornton Freeland. Cast: Eddie Cantor, EthelShutta, Paul Gregory, Eleanor Hunt, John Rutherford, SpencerCharters. A musical sparked by Cantor's performance as ahyper-hypochondriac. Out West, Henry Williams (Cantor) helps Sallyflee her wedding, unaware that she has left a note behind sayingthey've eloped. Features some of Busby Berkeley's most fancifulchoreography. ""As it facilitates intermarriage in The Jazz Singer,so blackface brings Whoopee!'s Indian and white lovers together.Henry, helping Sally escape her wedding to Sheriff Bob, hides in anoven. When the stove is lit, he explodes out in blackface. LikeWhiteman's lion, Jolson's mammy, and the prototypical, exaggeratedblackface mouth, the oven associates blackface with primitiveorality. The disguise fools Sheriff Bob and encourages Sally toconfess her love for Wanenis. Promoting anarchic violence againstthe forces of law and order, blackface also facilitatesintermarriage in the low plot. Cantor sings ""My Baby Just Cares forMe"" in blackface and sings it again sans cork to Nurse Custer toend the film. Transforming Jew from frightened melancholic intotrickster, blackface shifts the meaning of ""cares for"" from nursingto sex. When Sheriff Bob tries to wipe Henry clean, he leaves himwith what look like Orthodox Jewish earlocks and beard."" [Rogin,Michael.

                Directed by Haile Gerima. Cast: Kofi Ghanaba, OyafunmikeOgunlano, Alexandra Duah, Nick Medley, Mutabaruka, AfemoOmilami, Reginald Carter, Mzuri. Sankofa is an Akan word thatmeans, ""We must go back and reclaim our past so we can moveforward; so we understand why and how we came to be who we aretoday."" Written, directed and produced by Ethiopian-bornfilmmaker Haile Gerima, SANKOFA is a powerful film aboutMaafa-the African holocaust.

It empowers Black people on the screen byshowing how African peoples' desire for freedom made themresist, fight back, and conspire against their enslavers,overseers and collective past through the vision on Mona, whovisits her ancestral experience on a new world planation asShola. We share the life she endures as a slave and experiencesher growing consciousness and transformation [description fromweb site]. 1993. 125 min. ;
