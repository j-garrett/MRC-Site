"A Vision of the World","This program delves into Kahn's origins and formative years and the launch of his Archive of the Planet project. Topics include Kahn's Jewish ancestry and Alsacian upbringing; his early success in finance; his admiration of Japanese art and customs; the development of autochrome photography by the Lumière brothers; Marguerite Mespoulet's colorful documentation of Ireland's vanishing Celtic traditions; and Kahn's expedition to Cornwall and London with August Leon. 50 min. â€¢149;Men of the WorldIn 1908, Albert Kahn and his chauffeur embarked on a global trek to observe and absorb other cultures -- an early ""prototype' of the many photographic missions Kahn would fund over the years. this program illustrates that formative round-the-world trip as well as the 1913 journey undertaken by photographer Stéphane Passet to China, Mongolia and India. Viewers will encounter startling images of early 20th century Manhattan, San Francisco, Tokyo and Beijing, as well as views of nascent Rio de Janeiro and burgeoning Buenos Aires. Scenes from Tsarist Siberia, the Mongolian steppes, a Varanasi teeming with worshippers, and a camel-and-elephant caravan on the Khyber Pass reaffirm the spectacular value of Kahn's grand project. 52 min. â€¢149;Europe on the BrinkPoverty, emigration, declining birth rates, and ethnic divisions weakened many European countries as the 20th century began. From France to the Balkans, leaders prescribed nationalism and military buildup as the only solutions. This program studies the continent's march to war as depicted in the photographic record commissioned by French banker Albert Kahn. Early color images and film footage explore a range of themes -- including contrasts between urbanization and rural life in France, Germany and Scandinavia, the decline of the Ottoman Empire and its impact in Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and Macedonia; and the grittiness of everyday life in Europe. kahn's pacifism is also a topic. 51 min. â€¢149;The Soldiers' StoryAs World War I engulfed his country, Albert Kahn struck a deal with the French army: his team of photographers would capture images and footage that helped the war effort in exchange for direct access to militarized zones. A century later, this program presents the results -- revealing the life and environment of the French soldier as recorded in Kahn's Archive of the Planet. The visual details of trench warfare and all its misery are combined with pictures from towns, hospitals , and barracks a few miles from the front -- evoking the humanity of the ordinary fighting man as well as the appalling devastation wrought by the era's instruments of death. 52 min. â€¢149;The Civilians' Story: Albert Kahn's Archive of the PlanetIn addition to documenting the Great War, Albert Kahn's team of photographers recorded the impact of the conflict on French civilian ife. This program explores both the propaganda value and the genuine emotional power in images of the war-torn French populace. French and Belgian refugees, ruined churches, and farms tended by women and the elderly are a few of the subjects rendered in exquisite and moving detail. Soissons smolders after a German retreat; Reims and its shattered cathedral hover on the edge of total destruction; and the Alsace region, Kahn's birthplace, regains its French identity. 52 min. â€¢149;Europe After the FireVersailles, 1919: French banker Albert Kahn and his camera team are among the few photographers allowed inside the Hall of Mirrors for the treaty signing -- an example of Kahn's uncanny talent for documenting change. This program focuses on Kahn's pictorial record of the war's aftermath and the challenges of securing a true peace across Europe. Zeppelin-borne aerial footage conveys the scope of the destruction, while grave-digging and burial scenes evoke the staggering number of combatants killed. Other events and subjects include the influx of foreign workers that filled France's labor void; the French occupation of the Rhineland; German breadlines and Paris dance-halls; and war monuments in London and Verdun. 52 min. â€¢149;Middle East, The Birth of NationsNo sooner had Europe declared an end to its Great War than the seeds of new conflict were sewn -- in the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. With typical global awareness, photography archivist Albert Khan chose to document the historic changes occurring in the colonial Middle East. This program traces his team's expeditions into Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine as Western powers redrew the map of the region. The French takeover of Syria, the Balfour Declaration, and Turkey’s war with Greece come to life in Kahn’s street-level films and autochromes-- which also serve as reminders that Jerusalem, like many other Middle East locations, suffered greatly during World War I. 52 min. â€¢149;Far East, Expeditions to EmpiresFrom 1914 through much of the 1920's, Albert Kahn's photographic team was hard at work in Asia, amassing culturally and historically vital images. This program recounts journeys through Indochina and greater Asia in which the Kahn team opened up a world most Europeans had never dreamed of. Viewers discover Vietnam through its beggars, Tet celebrants and elegantly dressed Mandarin administrators; Cambodia, through its dancers and the imposing Angkor City complex; Japan, through rapidly Westernizing homes, dress and hairstyles; and India, through pictures of the maharajahs and other authorities rendered powerless by British rule. 51 min. â€¢149; The End of a WorldAs they built an unsurpassed visual archive of world culture, Albert Kahn and his photographers turned their attention to widely divergent locations. This program follows the maritime odyssey of Lucien Le Saint, circa 1922, as he captured on film the daily lives of Newfoundland cod fisherman, as well as expeditions into northwestern Africa. Images from Morocco and Tunisia focus on occupying French soldiers, the prostitutes they patronized, and larger changes in those societies, while pictures taken in Dahomey (now Benin) shed light on the symbiotic relationship between Catholocism and the Vodun religion. Viewers also learn about the Colonial Exhibition of 1931, Kahn's financial collapse, and the fate of his archive after his death in 1940. 51 min.

"Boomtime, 1948. (People's Century, 1997.)","After World War II, the USA enjoyed unparalleled prosperity while Europe and much of the rest of the world suffered from devastation, lack of food and other necessities, and unemployment. The American Marshall Plan assisted Europe greatly in its recovery from the war and helped Europeans learn the 'American way' of doing things. Europeans began changing their economy by themselves and became consumers as well as producers. This prosperity lasted until 1973, when the certainty of cheap oil and a world dominated by the West was over. It was the beginning of the end of the greatest boom of the century. 56 min.

"The Cold War. 1998. 47 min. each installment.","â€¢149;Comrades, 1917-1945. Though ideological enemies, the Soviet Union and the United States are allies against Hitler during WWII. At the end of the war, Europe is divided, and the one-time allies now confront each other knowing that the United States has the atomic bomb. â€¢149;Iron Curtain, 1945-1947. The Soviet Union dominates Eastern Europe. Churchill warns of the consequences. Stalin insists that the governments of the Soviet Union's client states be pro-communist. Impoverished after the war, Great Britain opts out as a world power. The United States assumes the mantle of world leadership. â€¢149; Marshall Plan, 1947-1952. The United States adopts the Truman doctrine, pledging to defend freedom worldwide. Secretary of State George Marshall plans to bolster economic recovery in Europe. Seeing this as a threat, Stalin forbids his satellites to participate. The world effectively divides. â€¢149;Berlin, 1948-1949 In Berlin, the American, British and French sectors form a Western enclave in the Soviet zone of divided Germany. In June 1948, the Soviets blockade the city, but the Western allies successfully airlift in supplies. In August 1949, Soviet scientists explode an atomic bomb, establishing nuclear parity between the two superpowers. â€¢149; Reds, 1947-1953. Following Stalin's domination of Eastern Europe and the loss of China, American democracy falls victim to anti-communist hysteria, but survives it. Eisenhower is elected President. In the Soviet Union, Stalin reinforces the climate of terror on which his rule is based. When he dies in 1953, the Soviet people mourn the end of an era. â€¢149;Korea, 1949-1953. In June 1950, North Korea invades the South, with Stalin's blessing. The United States, backed by the United Nations, defends South Korea, and then is confronted by communist China. In mid-1951, the war grinds to a bloody stalemate but eventually an armistice is signed. Aggression has been contained. â€¢149; After Stalin, 1953-1956. Thaw is conceivable with Stalin's death. Khrushchev outmaneuvers Malenkov for power and visits the West. Germans, Poles and Hungarians attempt to rise against Soviet rule. In 1956, an uprising in Hungary is ruthlessly crushed by Soviet tanks. The United States, pledged to contain rather than overthrow communism, does nothing. â€¢149;Sputnik, 1949-1961. In the mid-50s, the Soviet Union seems to be forging ahead. In October 1957, the first Soviet satellite Sputnik orbits the earth--to the dismay and fear of the United States, frustrated by its own ineffectual space program. In 1961, the Soviets launch Yuri Gargarin into space. America will have to meet the challenge. â€¢149; The Wall, 1958-1963. The fate of Germany remains unresolved. West Germany has been admitted to NATO. Within East Germany, Berlin is divided between East and West by an open border. Thousands seize the chance to flee the communist system. To keep their people in, the East Germans, with Soviet backing, build The Wall. â€¢149;Cuba, 1959-1962. Khruschev decides, with Castro's agreement, to install short-range and medium-range missiles in Cuba, only 90 miles from the U.S. The United States detects the missile sites and blockades the island. The superpowers confront each other; but rather than embark on nuclear war, they each step back. â€¢149;Vietnam, 1954-1968. Vietnam has been divided since the end of French colonial rule. The North is run by communists, the South by anti-communists. Ignoring warnings against involvement in a nationalist struggle, the United States commits its armed forces. American protests against the war mount as the U.S. begins to realize this is not a war it can win. â€¢149; MAD, 1960-1972. Throughout the 60s, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are locked in a nuclear stand-off; each realizes that bombing the enemy could provoke retaliation and self-destruction. Nuclear strategy evolves into Mutual Assured Destruction, or MAD, in which both sides are guaranteed certain annihilation in the event of nuclear war. â€¢149; Make Love Not War, The Sixties. Western economies grow and prosper, fueled partly by armaments production. Rejecting their parents' affluence and the Cold War, many of the young protest and rebel. There is racial violence in U.S. inner cities while rock music comes to express the mood of a disenchanted generation. â€¢149; Red Spring, The Sixties.In the Soviet bloc, communist rule stifles ambition and achievement. Soviet defense expenditure cripples economic growth. The young lust for totems of America's youth culture--blue jeans and rock-n-roll. In Czechoslovakia, Dubcek attempts limited reform, but in 1968, Soviet force crushes the Prague Spring. â€¢149; China, 1949-1972. Chinese communists win the longest civil war in 20th century history. Mao's land reforms are popular but in 1958, he embarks on a series of catastrophic changes. China maintains an increasingly uneasy relationship with the Soviet Union. In 1960 the Sino-Soviet split paves the way for President Nixon's historic visit to Beijing. â€¢149; Detente, 1969-1975. North Vietnam launches a new offensive against the South. The U.S. steps up its bombing campaign but seeks peace through diplomacy. Nixon and Brezhnev sign the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The U.S. finally withdraws from Vietnam. Detente culminates in the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. â€¢149; Good Guys, Bad Guys, 1967-1978 The superpowers use surrogates to wage ideological and often physical conflict. In 1967 and 1973, American backed-Israel triumphs over Soviet-backed Egypt and Syria. In Africa, the Soviets exploit nationalist, anti-colonial struggles. The U.S. supports South Africa in its battle against communism. â€¢149; Backyard, 1954-1990. The U.S. has always regarded Latin America as its own backyard. Fearing the spread of communism, it seeks to destabilize leftist governments. In 1973, the CIA helps overthrow the Chilean President Salvador Allende; in the 1980s, it supports right-wing extremists in Nicaragua and El Salvador. â€¢149; Freeze, 1977-1981. Concern for human rights in the East grows; detente ebbs. The Soviets arm Eastern Europe. The U.S. threatens to site missiles in Western Europe. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan ends detente. Promising tougher measures against Moscow, Reagan defeats Carter for the presidency. In Poland, martial law is imposed. â€¢149; Soldiers of God, 1975-1988. Afghanistan is a war that costs the lives of almost 15,000 Soviet conscripts and an estimated one million Afghans. The U.S. supplies billions of dollars of weapons to unlikely allies--Islamic fundamentalists. The result is a Vietnam-style conflict which takes its toll on the Soviets and hastens the end of the Cold War. â€¢149; Spies, 1944-1994. Early CIA attempts to penetrate the Iron Curtain are thwarted. The U.S. reacts with increasingly sophisticated technological intelligence--the U-2 spy-plane, satellite reconnaissance and electronic eavesdropping. Yet human spies remain important. Sometimes betrayers, sometimes betrayed, many spies pay with their lives. â€¢149; Star Wars, 1980-1988. Reagan boosts U.S. defense spending and proposes the Strategic Defense Initiative, an anti-missile system in space. New premier Gorbachev knows the Soviets can't match the U.S., and wants to liberalize and reconstruct the Russian economy. After summits in Geneva, Reykjavik and Washington, the leaders agree to drastic arms cuts. â€¢149; The Wall Comes Down, 1989. Incredibly quickly, the Soviet bloc is breaking up, virtually without bloodshed. First Poland, then Hungary, then East Germany slip away from communist control. Gorbachev makes no effort to hold them back with force. Amid scenes of jubilation, the hated Berlin Wall comes down. â€¢149; Cold War. ConclusionsThe U.S. proves the stronger, the Soviet Union implodes. Germany is reunified. Shorn of its empire and communist domination, Russia faces its future with its economy in chaos. The balance of terror that has kept the peace for more than 40 years vanishes. The Cold War has ended without the use of nuclear weapons.

"Great War and the Shaping of the 20th Century. 58 min. each. 1996.","â€¢149; Explosion. The World War of 1914 to 1918, the Great War, was the first of the major catastrophes of the 20th century. This episode, the first of eight, examines the causes of World War I. The program affords coverage of the assassination of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the turbulent political climate throughout Europe as factors which led to the outbreak of war. â€¢149; Stalemate.This program examines the military operations of 1914, with emphasis on the Western Front. Almost from the outset, World War I became a stalemate with a line of trenches stretching from the Swiss Alps to the English Channel. This episode, the second of eight, explores why the war devolved into one of trench warfare. â€¢149; Total War. This episode of the Great War, the third of eight, examines the evolution of World War I from a conflict fought across the landscape of Europe to a global war. Coverage is afforded events in Great Britain and Turkey. The use of terror in modern war and the evolution of ""total war"" -- especially regarding aerial and chemical weapons -- is explored in this program. â€¢149;Slaughter. This episode, the fourth of eight, examines the military operations of the Western Front through the eyes of the soldiers who manned the trenches and fought the battles. Through study of the battles of Verdun, the Somme and Passchendaele, a social portrait of the common soldier is developed and analyzed. â€¢149;Mutiny. This episode of the Great War, the fifth of an eight part series, examines the toll that the war was taking on the soldiers and civilians by 1917. Unrest on the homefront and mutiny on the Western Front posed vexing problems for political leaders and military planners. On the Eastern Front, resentment toward the war effort would turn into rebellion and then revolution. â€¢149;Collapse. Episode six of the Great War examines the critical year of 1918. After the mutiny within the French Army and revolution in Russia, the Germans were still firmly entrenched on the Western Front. The arrival of the United States forces in Europe would determine the outcome of the war. This program probes the issue of American involvement as the deciding factor in Germany's defeat. â€¢149;Hatred and Hunger. Episode seven of the Great War examines the end of World War I with emphasis on unresolved issues from the Balkans to the Middle East. World War I brought the collapse of four empires, the death of nine million soldiers and the ruin of much of Europe. The struggle to rebuild lives, countries and governments would set the stage for an even greater catastrophe a generation later. â€¢149;War Without End. The final episode of the Great War explores the aftermath of World War I and the failed peace. For the ""lost generation,"" the war would be without end as they struggled with broken hopes, broken families and broken lives. In Germany, the sense of betrayal and dishonor prompted some Germans to seek revenge. The man who rose up to lead them was Adolph Hitler.

"Inside the European Union","Dist.: Ѭ href=""http://www.films.com"">Films Media Group.Ж 2007. 26 min. each installmentâ€¢149;No Colors: Racism and Prejudice in Modern Europe. Program looks at racism and xenophobia brought to the surface by the massive influx of foreign workers and job-seekers into Western Europe. Describes the search for equitable solutions by moderate European Union leaders and citizens. Examines Islamophobia, religious fundamentalism, the radicalization of young Muslim men, and racism in football or soccer. â€¢149; Parliament Under Pressure. Defining ""European"" is one of the main challenges facing the European Union Parliament. This program outlines the history of the governing body and assesses the actions it has taken to shape and organize the EU. Shedding light on electoral and procedural methods adopted by the Parliament, the film documents political fanfare and maneuvering accompanying the eastward expansion of the union with the entry of Bulgaria and Romania. The program also shows how these developments influence the path to comprehensive immigration laws --and how foreign workers, illegal immigrants, and asylum seekers are affected. Several members of the EU Parliament are interviewed. â€¢149;Help Wanted: Dynamics of the EU Labor Market. With a low birth rate and an aging workforce, the European Union needs immigrants--but how temporary or permanent their status should be is a matter of debate. This film examines existing and proposed guest worker programs, in addition to other EU measures, designed to address the results of globalization and shifting demographics. Focusing not only on the EU's tremendous economic advances but also on regions afflicted by poverty, the film looks at immigrant education, ambition, and self-employment, while sifting through issues such as worker job security and the growth of sex industries. â€¢149;Human Trafficking: A Crisis for the EU and the World. Europe's wealth represents a golden opportunity for those who smuggle cheap, easily exploited workers across international borders. But how does the loathsome mechanism of human trafficking actually occur, and what are EU authorities doing to fight it? This program investigates by recording the experiences of human trafficking victims and evaluating the work of the EU government in the battle against 21st-century slavery. Corruption, prostitution, victim protection and repatriation, and the creation of FRONTEX--the agency responsible for European border patrol--are all highlighted, while members of the European Parliament and other officials discuss what must be done to improve anti-smuggling efforts. â€¢149;Identities: Culture and Nationality in Europe Today. What prevents minority communities from joining the European mainstream? Is there an appropriate balance between assimilation and preserving one's cultural heritage? This program wrestles with questions of identity --racial, cultural, and sexual--resulting from the startling new diversity of European society. Depicting daily life in immigrant communities on the Continent and in Great Britain, the film features observations from African, Asian, and Middle Eastern transplants. Each offers his or her personal take on learning a new language, eating unfamiliar foods, adapting to foreign attitudes toward women and gays, and other dilemmas. In addition, European MP Wolf Klinz puts forward his belief that immigrants should be required to learn the language of their adopted country. â€¢149;Stop the Flow: Analyzing the Causes of EU Immigration. Can Western aid to the developing world help to stem the tide of foreign workers into the EU? This program reports on European initiatives intended to improve conditions in Africa and the Middle East and thus reduce the number of job-seekers entering the European Union. With a spotlight on human rights, fair trade, the global war on poverty, the role of the private sector, and the frustrations of young unemployed foreigners, the program uses Morocco as a specific case study and also outlines the significance of the Middle East peace process.

Despite Woodrow Wilson's promise of a ""people's peace"", defeated nations were resentful and unreconciled.

"La Commune (Paris 1871) (198-?)","La Commune was the name given to the revolutionary government established by the people of Paris in 1871. This presents an in-depth account of the major characters of the Commune of 1871 whose members followed either Louis August Blanqui or the philosopher Pierre Joseph Proudhon. The film travels back to 1871 and is not only a lesson in history but presents a demonstration of how history is shaped, and re-shaped, by the tellers of the tale. In this particular case activities of the Commune are broadcast by a journalist for Versailles Television who presents the official view while a Commune television station is set up to present the perspectives of the Paris rebels. A film by Peter Watkins, 2000. 345 min. ;

"Drowning by Bullets.","On the evening of October 17, 1961 about 30,000 Algerians, ostensibly French citizens, descended upon the boulevards of central Paris to protest an 8:30 curfew.

Demonstrators were beaten, shot, even drowned in the Seine. This film exposes the massacre, and the cover-up. Directed and produced by Philip Brooks and Alan Hayling 1982. 52 min. ;

The first part of this documentary shows the brickmakers of Zehdenick, a small town in Brandenburg, and their grim living and working conditions. Made less than 2 years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, it was banned by the East German authorities and only allowed to be shown after cuts were made. The second part of the documentary was made in the same town after the wall came down. It begins with a retrospective to the earlier film, namely the conversation with the brickmakers which had to be cut from 'Brandenburg Bricks'. The inhabitants feel that their future is uncertain. The political parties fighting for their attention in the coming election of March 1990 are utterly incomprehensible to them. 90 min.

","â€¢149;The Dream of an Empire. Although Rudolph von Hapsburg was crowned in 1273, the Hapsburg dynasty did not firmly establish itself until Frederick III passed the crown to his son, Maximilian I, in 1493. This program traces the roots of the struggle, showing how the Hapsburg dynasty eventually established itself, both in Austria and Spain, shaping the course of European history for the next six centuries. â€¢149; Cross and Crescent. The internal and external forces set in motion during the 16th and 17th centuries changed Europe forever. This program examines the political, religious, and class conflicts that led to the Thirty Years War. It shows how the Turkish forces advanced to the gates of Vienna and were defeated, establishing the boundaries of modern Europe. â€¢149; New Mission. The death of Charles VI in 1740 without a male heir led to a dynastic crisis and conflict between the Hapsburgs and the Hollenzollerns. Frederick the Great's rule embodied the Enlightenment as he granted equality to all citizens and established public education. But Maria Theresa's claim to the throne was not widely accepted. The ensuing Seven Years War was a pivotal struggle that firmly established Maria Theresa on the throne, where she ruled for forty years, followed by her son, Joseph II. â€¢149; Peoples' Prison, Peoples' Shelter. This final segment examines the liberal forces at work in the 19th century, the conservative policies of the Hapsburg rulers, and the inevitable results of this conflict. It shows how demands for greater freedom, combined with Metternich's resignation, eventually resulted in greater oppression. In examining the revolution of 1848, the program shows the resulting policy of security over liberty and preservation rather than renewal.

Two documentary films and four shorts created by the noted German producer and director Alexander Kluge. Krieg unde Frieden (War and peace): This documentary and fiction film was a cooperative writing effort by five different German writers and/or directors, one of the most noted being the 1972 Nobel prize winner Heinrich Boll. Boll was specifically responsible for three fictive episodes at the end of the film that promote an anti-nuclear, pro-peace message (""Space Talk,"" ""Atom Bunker,"" and ""Kill Your Sister""). Documentary footage of Chancellors Helmut Kohl and Helmut Schmidt in action, along with various European and American leaders highlight the urgent issues of the day. Der Kandidat (The Candidate): This political documentary puts together clips from newsreels, archives, and television to review the controversial career of Franz Josef Strauss who was running for Chancellor of West Germany at the time this documentary was made. Strauss founded the Christian Socialist Union and had a long political history as a parliamentarian (1949), Special Minister (1952), and by 1955 was Minister of Defense. His career began to unravel when a series of scandals hit the presses that involved him in kickbacks and abuses of power. Strauss was forced to resign his post as Defense Minister in the early 1960s. Films were originally produced 1993-2006.

Some now call women the great losers of the East German revolution. Yet, interviews with these very women show a wide spectrum of responses to the changes in their lives.

"Rockin' the Wall","When the Berlin Wall went up in 1960, it became the worldwide symbol of communist oppression. While the Wall kept people in, it could not keep Western influences like rock music out. Through Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, rock music penetrated the Iron Curtain with messages of freedom and rebellion. This film presents the history of the Berlin Wall through the experiences of well-known rock musicians and those who lived behind the wall. Among the rock musicians featured are Robby Krieger (The Doors), Mark Stein and Vinny Martell (Vanilla Fudge), Rudy Sarzo (Quiet Riot), David Paich (Toto), Jimmy Haslip (Yellowjackets), and the group Mother's Finest who played in East Berlin just weeks before the Wall fell. People who lived behind the Iron Curtain in several countries describe what their lives were like and how rock music provided them an important lifeline and inspiration, giving them hope and exposing the short-comings of the communist system. The film includes historical footage of the famous speeches at the Berlin Wall by Presidents Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy, as well as interviews with former government officials and with European rocker Leslie Mandoki who recalls being visited by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to discuss the power of music.

"That Was the GDR (Das war die DDR: eine Geschichte des anderen Deutschland).","A seven part documentary of the history of Communist East Germany told from the people's own point of view. 1993.â€¢149;Part 1: I was a Citizen of the GDR (Ich war Bürger der DDR) Former GDR citizens tell of their personal feelings, experiences and attitudes toward the GDR as well as both material difficulties and the dominance of the State. They reflect on historical events such as the uprising on the 17th of June, 1953, the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall and the suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, while also conveying a sense of the hope that was pinned on Gorbachev's Perestroika. Directors, Gitta Nickel, Wolfgang Schwarze 90 min. ; â€¢149;Part 2: From Zone to State (Von der Zone zum Staat) Germany was a trophy in the struggle between the new powers after two world wars. This segment considers the events leading up to the construction of the Berlin Wall on August 13, 1961 -- the final division between the two German states. Here the focus is not only on major political events but also on the spirit of the times as reflected in images from film, photographs, posters, caricatures, pop-songs and speeches. Director, Donat Schober. 45 min. ; â€¢149;Part 3: From Plan to Penury (Vom Plan zur Pleite) In the beginning was the plan. The motto for economy and development in the GDR meant also the departure from personal property. This film follows the development of the GDR's planned economy from its beginning to its failure. It spans from success reports from the economic front, to standing in line for goods, to severe damage to the environment arising from extreme depletion of natural resources. Director, Günther Scholz. 45 min. ; â€¢149;Part 4: For the Welfare of the People (In Fürsorge für das Volk) This segment centers on the Honecker era when the program for social policy of the Socialist Unity Party called for the ""unity of economic and social policy."" Thus the Party leadership celebrated the achievemnt of the tight social service network extending from day-care to retirement home. But the further individuals are removed from the processes of production, the more useless they become from an economic perspective. How much social security did the State really provide? Directors, Gitta Nickel, Uwe Belz, Wolfgang Schwarze. 45 min. ; â€¢149;Part 5: Mind and Might (Geist und Macht) This segment examines the struggles and repressions of art and culture in East Germany. The history of literature and art in the GDR is repeatedly interrupted by State repression. The film examines how this situation revealed contradictions between intellect and power in the GDR -- between the State's proclamations and reality -- spanning from Becher to Biermann. Directors, Christian Klemke, Lothar Kompatzki. 45 min. ; â€¢149;Part 6: Shield and Sword (Schild und Schwert) The Ministry for State Security (MfS) was from its founding in 1950 the central instrument of domination, for defense against external and internal enemies. The Stasi, the political secret police, conducted surveillance and investigated punishable activity. A gigantic European surveillance apparatus ultimately appears -- spies and informants with German thoroughness, millions of victims and mountains of files in the ""Gauck Archives."" Directors, Anne Worst, Arnold Seul. 45 min. ; â€¢149;Part 7: We Are the People (Wir Sind das Volk) ""We are the people"" was the chant of 70,000 protesters in the streets of Leipzig. This final segment covers the end of the GDR. It begins as the GDR enjoys its greatest success, recognition by the Federal Republic of Germany -- the hope for two German States and a peaceful coexistence. From this point on the GDR walked a tightrope between detente and diverging from the West, until its eventual downfall. Director, Martina Körbler. 45 min. ;

"The Moroccan Labyrinth (Laberinto Marroqui)","In 1898 Spain focused its colonial aims on northern Morocco, establishing a Spanish Protectorate in 1912. From 1920 to 1926, Spanish military attempts to conquer the territory were resisted by the guerrilla forces of Rif leader Abd el-Krim. The film reveals how this colonial conflict served as the prologue to the Spanish Civil War, with losses in the African war undermining the monarchy and politically emboldening the ""African militarists,"" including generals such as Francisco Franco, who in 1936 launched a revolt against the Spanish Republic. Ironically, in order to escape famine and poverty, thousands of Moroccans enlisted in the Spanish Falangist movement and found themselves fighting for their former enemies in Spain against Republican forces.

"Into the Rising Sun.","1999. 52 min. each installment.â€¢149; The Barrier of Fear. In 1415, Cape Bojador along the northwest coast of Africa marked the point at which the known world ended and superstition began. Voyages of exploration spearheaded by Portugal's Prince Henry the Navigator conquered that fear of the unknown-- launching the colonial era and establishing a slave trade that decimated the African continent. â€¢149; Beyond the Cape of Storms. With West Africa mapped, Portugese explorers continued down the coast, seeking the turning point of an eastbound trading route to India. Epic voyages revealed myriad cultures, thousands of miles of harsh terrain, and eventually, the southernmost tip of the continent. Dubbed the Cape of Storms by explorer Bartolomeu Dias, the king of Portugal renamed it the Cape of Good Hope. â€¢149; The Passage to India. Da Gama completes a two-year, 27,000-mile round trip to India, returning with a handful of spices and establishing a Portuguese presence along the East African coast and Indian subcontinent. A single eyewitness account by Alvaro Velho survives to detail the arduous voyage and da Gama's determination, while present-day footage reveals the lasting implications of the journey on new lands. â€¢149; A Liar's Tale With the sea route to India established, young merchant adventurer Mendes Pinto pushes on throughout Asia in the 16th century. Witnessing world events from the Red Sea to Japan, he helps position Portugal as a major economic player in the East. While Pinto's accounts mingle the facts with the fantastical, his journey provides insight into the West's activities in the East.

"History of Britain: I and II","Volume I is a six part series exploring the history of Britain up to the 17th century; Volume II is a five part series exploring the history of Britain from Elizabeth I. 2001.â€¢149;History of Britain I: 3500 B.C - 1603 A.D. Volume 1.Contents: Beginnings (50 min.) -- Conquest (50 min.). Beginnings (Pt.1): Introduces the world of the prehistoric Britons, beginning in Skara Brae, 5,000 years ago, in a world of the embryonic village. Succeeding generations remained largely indigenous, trading with but not dominated by the Celts. Conquest (Pt.2): After the victory of William the Conqueror and the Norman Conquest, Britain ceased to look north and turned its face south, becoming part of an Anglo-Norman empire that in time, overshadowed even the kings of France. â€¢149;History of Britain I: 3500 B.C - 1603 A.D. Volume 2. Contents: Dynasty (50 min.) -- Nations (50 min.). Dynasty (Pt.3): The great Norman dynasty tears itself apart as cousins fight over who should be king. Out of their bloody struggle emerges a new dynasty as well as three of the most famous kings: Henry II, Richard I and John. At the heart of this medieval history lies the relationship between church and state, most notably represented by Thomas Becket and Henry II. Nations (Pt.4): In the 13th century, the people of Britain found their voice: proud and nationalistic, developed as a response to the subjugation in the campaigns of Edward I to extend his authority over Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Out of this attempted hegemony arose the first written expression of nationalism. â€¢149;History of Britain I: 3500 B.C - 1603 A.D. Volume 3. Contents: King Death (50 min.) -- Burning convictions (50 min.). King death (Pt.5): A great social transformation arises out of the Black Death that decimated the British population. Councilors and courtiers run the kings government and work with a parliament of members of the rising gentry class. The end of feudalism and the advent of the printing press lay the groundwork for the Reformation and later, the Industrial Revolution. Burning convictions (Pt.6.): Seeking a divorce, Henry VIII breaks away from the Pope and declares himself the head of the church in England. This is ultimately the story of three women, Anne Boleyn, Mary I and Elizabeth who along with Thomases Cranmer and Cromwell, bribed, tortured and cajoled a nation largely at peace with its Catholic soul into accepting Protestantism. â€¢149;History of Britain II: the Wars of the British, 1603-1776. Volume 4. Contents: The body of the queen (60 min.) -- The British wars (60 min.). Body of the Queen (Pt.7): Elizabeth I led a Protestant nation to greatness in a hostile Catholic world, all the while deflecting intense pressure to marry and conceive an heir. Her success stands in marked contrast to the fate of her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots. British wars (Pt.8): When Charles I ascended to the throne in 1625, he brought with him a firm belief in the divine right of kings putting him at odds with the parliament. Their struggle soon expanded to every corner of the British Isles, eventually reshaping England as a republic divided by religion, politics and ideology. â€¢149;History of Britain II: the Wars of the British, 1603-1776. Volume 5. Contents: Revolutions (60 min.) -- Britannia Incorporated (60 min.). Revolutions (Pt.9): England emerged from 50 years of civil wars a kingless republic led by Oliver Cromwell who closed parliament and led troops against Ireland and Scotland. After Cromwell died, Charles II was restored to the throne. His nearly 30 year rule was peaceful, unlike his brother and successor James II. Britannia Incorporated (Pt.10): England in the 1690s saw a new era under William II, while in Scotland the Jacobites still supported the deposed King James II. Yet half a century later the two nations would be forging a future together based on profit and commerce, not God. â€¢149;History of Britain II: the Wars of the British, 1603-1776. Volume 6, The Wrong Empire. The Wrong Empire (Pt.11): By the 18th century with political stability and commercial prosperity at home, Britain turned its sights outward. It's a story of exploration and daring -- but also of exploitation and conflict -- where a nation that considered itself the freest in the world ended up by subjugating most of it. 60 min. â€¢149;History of Britain III: Volume 7, Forces of Nature/Victoria and Her Sisters. Forces of nature (Pt. 12): Led by the radical intellectuals of the ""Romantic generation,"" Britain experienced a flowering of political discourse in the 18th century, based on an appreciation of nature and the common man. But while similar forces led to revolution in France, England avoided that bloody fate. Victoria and her sisters (Pt. 13): In 1837, the 18 year-old Queen Victoria ascended to the throne in the midst of a radical transformation driven by technology and industrialization. The young queen proved adept at managing these powerful forces, and her example paved the way for a generation of women to assume prominent roles in every area of British society. 60 min. each installment. â€¢149;History of Britain III: Volume 8, The Two Winstons Forces of nature (Pt. 12): This final episode of the series The two Winstons (Pt. 14) looks at two of the most influential 20th century Britons -- George Orwell and Winston Churchill. Though political opposites, they shared many convictions and gifts, and Schama's compelling analysis of their lives and legacies illuminates fundamental questions surrounding the role of history in society. 60 min.

"LondonЖ","A ""documentary"" portrait of the capital which can variously be described as an ""essay"" or a ""journal."" Images of London in 1992 are accompanied by an unnamed fictional narrator and Keiller's imaginary protagonist Robinson. The latter is attempting to research the city's artistic past and support alternative paths that the city's history might have taken. The film is made up of three ""expeditions"" and other mini-journeys on foot into a London that few tourists will ever see. The paths taken are inspired by literary-historical concerns but contemporary political events intrude. The two reflect on how political decisions might impact upon the city's future.

European bureaucrats, in the absence of an overarching E.U. policy feel compelled to keep as many immigrants out of Europe as possible, to please their increasingly anti-immigrant electorates. Discusses immigration policy in European Union countries and other countries hoping to join the Union. â€¢149;It's a Pack of Lies; Escape to the E.U.? Drawing on case studies, archival footage, and interviews, this documentary examines controversial changes in immigration policy in the European Union since the Geneva Refugee Convention of 1951 and their effects on present-day refugees and asylum-seekers. Five decades after the Convention, the European immigration system is on the verge of collapse as a flood of people fleeing persecution and violence threatens to engulf the E.U. â€¢149;Out They Go; One-way ticket to GhanaPeter Ekwiri, a Ugandan, is only one of many people whose applications for asylum in the E.U. have been denied. And like many other blacks from Africa considered ""undesirable"" by European governments such as Sweden and Germany, he was forcibly deported, but not to his home country. This program uses Ekwiri's case as a springboard to reveal a corrupt system in which E.U. police and immigration authorities clandestinely pay Ghana to act as a transfer point, in reality a dumping ground, for black deportees. And life in Ghana usually means years of imprisonment and an obscure death. The program also investigates other similar cases while exploring the statistical implications of European racial bias against black Africans.
