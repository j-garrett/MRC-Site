"Verticle City","2007. 28 min. each installment Dist.: Ѭ href=""http://www.films.com"">Films Media Group.Жâ€¢149;Q1, Australian Gold CoastThis program looks at the design and structural strength of Q1 Tower (Queensland Number One) and how it has affected the environment of Surfer's Paradise, once a trendy haven for beach bums. Looks at the imposing structure from more than one angle, studying its extraordinary design elements while asking: how has its pristine environment been affected? Viewers will learn about Q1's massive exterior canopy, its honeycomb core that reduces weight while maintaining structural strength, and the system of 26 supporting piles that had to be buried in the sandy soil beneath the tower. â€¢149;Torre Mayor, Mexico CityOne of the strongest buildings on the planet, Torre Mayor is constructed to withstand seismic movement that would obliterate the average skyscraper. Built in the wake of Mexico City's devastating 1985 earthquake, the tower is both a monument to engineering and a haven of safety in one of the world's most active seismic zones. This program focuses on the safety solutions behind Torre Mayor's innovative design. Viewers are introduced to its double-triangle diamond pattern, an ultra-solid combination of bracing and dampers, and the building's concrete-encased steel columns -- all resulting in a tower that does not sway significantly during a quake. â€¢149; Cira Centre, PhiladelphiaIt is an increasingly common scenario: a developer wants to build a tower in a depressed urban area, and must fill half the building before permits are issued. What's the ace in the hole? A superstar architect who brings media attention to the project. This program recounts such a story, in which Petronas Towers and Canary Wharf creator Cesar Pelli waved his magic design wand over the Cira Center project, making it stand apart from other Philadelphia high-rises. In addition to the building's design features, the program reflects on the question: are celebrity architects over-hyped and overpaid, and what--if any--public benefits exist to offset their staggering paychecks? â€¢149; Cologne CathedralAny serious study of the modern skyscraper must acknowledge its precurso--the Gothic cathedral. This program examines the design, construction, and history of Cologne Cathedral--which, for a grand total of four years, was the tallest building in the world. Dr. Barbara Schock-Werner, the cathedral's resident chief architect, describes political and cultural conditions during Cologne's initial building years and guides viewers through the evolution of the colossal church. Dr. Ulrike Brinkmann, in charge of the cathedral's acres of stained glass, sheds light on the religious meanings and architectural significance of the myriad colored windows. â€¢149; One Canada Square, LondonIn 1991, One Canada Square, the UK's tallest skyscraper, changed the London skyline. But the Cesar Pelli-designed icon did not rise up in the heart of the British capital. As this program describes, the developers undertook a billion-dollar gamble by creating an international financial center, symbolized by this obelisk-shaped tower, in the city's East End docklands. Viewers will learn about the complicated political and economic cooperation that had to occur before building could begin. The collapse of the global property market following completion of the complex--resulting in bankruptcy for the developers and darkness for a large section of the tower--is another major subject. â€¢149; Eureka Tower, MelbourneThis program looks at the high life while going down under--exploring Melbourne's 300-meter Eureka Tower, the tallest residential building in the world and the most exclusive address in the southern hemisphere. Featuring interviews with architect Nonda Katsalidis and developer Benni Aroni, the episode provides an in-depth tour of the dynamic structure and shows how its design is aimed at Australia's high-flyers. Viewers will learn about the building's exterior color scheme, a tribute to the Victorian Gold Rush, and its relationship to the interior shapes and décor. â€¢149; The Turning Torso, MalmoWhat happens when a city loses its trademark industry and the trademark architectural icon that goes with it? That was the problem facing the Swedish shipbuilding city of Malmo when the Kockums Crane was dismantled in 2002. This program illustrates the city's radical solution--a dramatic reinvention of its skyline and its socioeconomic image with the Turning Torso apartment building. Viewers will learn about the tower's unique sculptural origins, its twisted cube-stack shape, its unusual slanted windows, and its role in creating Malmo's post-industrial identity. The civic controversy that frequently accompanies daring building design is also explored. â€¢149; The Sears Tower, ChicagoThis program looks at how the $175 million Sears Tower broke boundaries in not only height but design and construction when it was completed in 1973. Examines architect Bruce Graham's innovations and their intended results--including better light, better ventilation, and better conditions for workers. Viewers are introduced to 1960s-era developments in steel and plate glass technology, replacing the heavy masonry walls of earlier skyscraper designs. The nearly crippling financial costs of funding such an iconic tower are also explored. â€¢149; Commerzbank, FrankfurtThe skyscraper is a symbol of aspiration and power - and an environmentally unsound energy guzzling monster. But in 1997 British superarchitect Norman Foster created a contradiction in terms - the world's first ecological tower and in doing so, The Commerzbank in Frankfurt has changed the construction of office buildings forever. This episode features a tour of the building and an extended conversation with its chief architect, Stefan Behling. â€¢149;Seven World Trade Center, New YorkNo setting is more important in the history of office tower design than the famous skyline of Manhattan. After the 9/11 attacks scarred the cityscape, architects began to rethink the priorities involved in dramatically vertical building design. This episode profiles 7 World Trade Center, the first building to be constructed on Ground Zero. Viewers will encounter the structure's surprising shape-a result of changes in its downtown environment-and discover how the building has taken occupant safety to new levels with a thickened concrete core, stairwells 50 percent wider than code requirements, and a lobby with a blast-resistant glass facade.

"[Neutra, Richard] VDL Research House: Richard Neutra's Studio and Residence","The VDL Research House was designed by architect Richard Neutra in 1932 and served as his studio and residence for the rest of his career. Uniquely among his projects, it represented the three major phases of his aesthetic development. It exemplified his early works, which featured compact volumes in white or silver, with thin surfaces and bands of windows. The Garden house built behind the VDL house in 1939 shows an emphasis on indoor/outdoor living, with its large windows and deep overhangs, typical of his work in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The original house was destroyed by fire in 1963 and rebuilt in 1966. Neutra's post-war work reflected his interest in environmental design, seen in the VDL House II with its use of site and climate responsive features. Special features: 40 min. documentary film on VDL I & II; additional interviews with Lauren Weiss Bricker, Director, Archives/Special Collections at Caifornia State Polytechnic University, Pomona, College of Environmental Design, and Judith Sheine, Chair of Architecture; Appearances by Neutra's sons Dion and Raymond, historian Thomas Hines and Neutra associate John Blanton; Includes an interactive tour featuring photographs, drawings and virtual reality panoramas for 360° viewing; Includes archive of original VDL I & II construction drawings and Neutra's travel sketches; historical photographs by Julius Shulman.

"[Havana]Havana -- The New Art of Making Ruins (Havanna -- Die Neue Kunst Ruinen zu Bauen)","In recent years, Havana has become famous all over the world for the morbid charm of its flaking facades. But these ruins are far less poetic for the people who inhabit them. Houses frequently collapse causing fatalities. This unique documentary tells the stories of the people who reside in these modern ruins, from a homeless man who lives in an abandoned theater, to an expropriated landowner who struggles against the decay of his parental home, to a writer who conceives a philosophy of the ruins to explain the gradual collapse of the city and its political system. A mixture of private history, memories, fears and hopes for the future, this documentary explores the quixotic relationship between man and architecture, man and ruins (commenting along the way on the ruin-tourism that has developed in Cuba). Spanning the entire history of Cuban architecture, from the colonial era up through the socialist revolution, this film captures the final moments of these historic buildings before they're renovated -- or simply collapse altogether.

"[New York]New York, A Documentary Film.","Directed by Ric Burns. 1999. 120 min. each installment.See also:â€¢149; Burns, Ric. New York : an illustrated history. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, c2003. (ENVI: F128.3 .N585 2003)â€¢149; Episode One, The Country and the City. Covers the rise of New York from its discovery in 1609 through the explosion of commercial growth sparked by the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825. The film examines the defining role the Dutch played in the development of the city's character, the impact of the British empire and the horrors of slavery, the establishment of the Stock Exchange, New York's fateful role in the American revolution and its brief tenure as the nation's capital. â€¢149; Episode Two, Order and Disorder. Chronicles the rise of New York commencing in 1825 from a merchant city to an industrial one. With the explosion of the immigrant population came social problems of every kind. By 1860, every tension in America could be felt on the streets of New York, now the most powerful and divided--city in the nation. Then the Civil War brought on civil disturbance in the form of the Draft Riots of 1863. â€¢149; Episode Three, Sunshine and Shadow. Covers New York City during the period after the Civil War-- ""the Gilded Age."" From 1865 through 1898, the city grows at a staggering rate--demographically, geographically and financially--and takes on enormous challenges such as the building of the Brooklyn Bridge, and sees the rise of Tammany Hall and Boss Tweed. By the end of the decade, New York has become home to the world's greatest concentration of wealth, and of poverty. â€¢149; Episode Four, The Power and the People. Covers the years from 1898 through 1918 showing how New York's industry drew in people from all over the world, and how these immigrants transformed the city physically, culturally and finally politically. Looks also at the construction of the subway system, Penn Station, Grand Central Terminal and the skyscrapers on Wall Street. The episode ends with the tragedy of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire and the reform legislation passed in its aftermath. â€¢149; Episode Five, Cosmopolis. Examines the roaring twenties in New York City as it becomes the cultural capital of the world with its hybrid cultural style that mixes high culture and low, black culture and white. This episode concludes with the skyscraper war, the rise & crash of the stock market and the construction of the Empire State Building. â€¢149; Episode Six, City of Tomorrow. Examines the dramatic and increasingly fateful events following the crash of 1929--as the greatest depression in American history plunged the city and nation into economic gloom. Two men came to the fore -- Fiorello La Guardia and Robert Moses, who attempted to create a bold new city of the future. Charting the demise of Mayor Jimmy Walker and the ascendancy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, this pivotal episode traces the fate of Harlem and the immense public works projects such as the Triborough Bridge and La Guardia Airport. â€¢149; Episode Seven, The City and the World. Examines the history of New York from the end of World War II to the present. Explores the complexities of the city and the physical, social and cultural change in the years following the war. The episode treats the great African American and Puerto Rican in-migrations; the beginnings of white flight and suburbanization and the massive physical changes wrought by highways and urban renewal. â€¢149; Episode Seven, The Center of the World. Looks at the rise and fall of the World Trade Center, whose epic fifty-year history sheds new light on every theme and issue in the city's long march to the center of the world. The episode comes to a climax with the harrowing events of September 11, 2001 and the extraordinary response of the city's people to the worst crisis in their history.

"[New York]New York: The World's City (Global Cities series)","To describe New York City's cultural makeup, the best metaphor is a salad bowl rather than a melting pot.

Less inclined to learn English and join mainstream society than previous immigrant generations, recently arrived New Yorkers are nevertheless part of a long-established pattern--which former Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) praises, while New York State Senator Frank Padavan discusses fears that some conservative citizens harbor.
